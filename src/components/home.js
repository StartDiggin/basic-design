                    My name is Johnny, I am working on learning another language and I figured
                    React was a good one to learn. Here are a few of my starter projects. Take a
                    look and I hope this helps anyone who is trying to learn React and is out of 
                    ideas of what to build.

                    Thank you for stopping in, have a good one!!!
                </p>
